This cat website was made with catapi, purposely made to challenge myself with apis with class react components.
This website is made with Class react components and it's getting annoying now, it's about time for to head to the latest version of react.

# Note
This project is unfinished, so it will feel empty, at least I have gotten all the functionalities I wanted right.
I'll be back some time in the future making adjustments into this.
